        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m The Thinking Dev and my name is Babatope Loko.</p>
        <p>Welcome to my corner of the digital universe, where creativity meets code and philosophy blends effortlessly with technology. My passion is deeply rooted in the intricate worlds of AI, Machine Learning, and coding—domains that constantly challenge and inspire me to push boundaries, question assumptions, and create something meaningful.</p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My journey into tech started quietly, with curiosity sparking in my teenage years. Building computers from scratch taught me patience, precision, and a profound appreciation for “what goes on under the hood.” And then came The Matrix—a film that didn’t just entertain me, but lit a fire within, fuelling a desire to learn how to shape reality through code.</p>
        <p>Yet, for a long while, self-doubt held me back. I watched from the sidelines, inspired yet hesitant, as technology evolved rapidly around me. But life has a funny way of teaching through contemplation; diving into Stoicism helped shift my perspective, revealing courage in places I’d previously overlooked. Through deep reflection, disciplined learning, and diving headfirst into coding projects, I finally stepped off the sidelines and into the game.</p>
        <p>Today, I embrace coding as far more than symbols on a screen. It’s creativity unleashed, the embodiment of imagination and logic combined. With the revolutionary growth of AI, we’re witnessing the dawn of a limitless horizon—a future ripe with possibilities.</p>
        <p>Inspired by Steve Jobs’s challenge to “dent the universe,” I’ve committed myself not only to continuous growth but also to empowering others—like you—to harness technology, unleash creativity, and accomplish extraordinary things.</p>
